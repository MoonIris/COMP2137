#For OS I use hostnameclt and well as grep -E, -E to make it more flexible in its serach. Then use awk to print out only the distro's name and version
#Uptime using uptime -p to only give the uptime without the extra fluff. Used sed to get rid of up to make it look cleaner

#RAM is very similar to CPU. This time using free -h and using grep -E to get the mem size that is installed and using awk to only print the installed ram, no extras
#For DISKS I use lsblk to bring up the disks using -o to only display NAME,SIZE,MODEL and use grep -v to exclude any lines which have loop. Leaving only the installed disks
#For VIDEO I use lspci to bring up Video and use grep to grab VGA and awk -F : to print only after the third : leaving only the make and model of the video
